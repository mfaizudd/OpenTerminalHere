# OpenTerminalHere
This is a simple autohotkey script to open windows terminal based on currently opened windows explorer's path. I use this script because I already accustomed with kde's default shortcut in openSUSE

# Usage
SHIFT+F4: Open windows terminal in current directory

CTRL+ALT+T: Open windows terminal
